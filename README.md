# ACC2019
Simulation Gains

The files of this repository contain every gain used in the simulations presented on the paper "Gain Scheduling Resonant Control for Saturating LPV Systems", submited to the American Control Conference 2019.

The file "gains_acc2019.mat" contain the data itself, while the file "gains_acc2019.m" is responsible to export the data to MATLAB and explain in which simulation the gains were used.
